# What can you do with a drone?
<h3 style="font-family:italics;">1) Aerial Photo & Videography (Take photos and make videos)</h3>

Cameras on drones are designed to take videos and pictures.

Photography drones these days are typically designed with 4K-quality cameras.

These cameras are usually stabilized on a gimbal and can be moved and controlled to get the right shot in the direction you want.

Some are designed with guards around their lenses. 

The guards help to keep the lenses from being at risk of damages from weather conditions in an area or any debris that might fly around.

The controller used for such a drone will often come with a button. This button can be pressed to allow the camera to take pictures or start filming. 

A smartphone or tablet can be set up to link up to a drone through a Wi-Fi connection though so you can get a quick look at what is on its camera.

<h3 style="font-family:italics;">3) Disaster Management</h3>
It can click pictures of the people stuck in the flood, burned building or any disaster.

It will help in people getting out of the flood, building or any disaster and can also help in transferring food, water and medical aid in emergencies.

They reduce the time required to locate victims and the time required for subsequent intervention by searching a large area in a short period of time, in addition to providing critical information to rescuers about the route that needs to be taken during search and rescue operations. 
Additionally, drones are capable of searching for alive victims buried beneath rubble using sensors such as noise sensing, binary sensing, vibration, and heat sensing.

These demonstrate the benefits of having drones on-site during disasters and the capability of drones as critical tools for acquiring aerial images.

<h3 style="font-family:italics;">4) Military (Mainly Used For Transporting Weapons)</h3>
Both the U.S. military and the CIA use drones as part of conventional fighting in war zones as well as to conduct targeted killings of individuals They say they are suspected of terrorism, and have done so both inside and outside of battlefields.

Military can transfer weapons through drone for the soldiers in the war.

<h3 style="font-family:italics;">5) Entertainment</h3>
Intel is redefining night time entertainment through the Intel Shooting Stars Drones.

A fleet of hundreds of drones light up the night sky and paint amazing images and animations – and it is all controlled by one pilot.

The tech company set out to set a world record by flying over 1,200 drones

<h3 style="font-family:italics;">6) Delivery</h3>
Some drones are designed to transport materials. 

A delivery drone will work with an anchor or basket-like feature on the bottom part. 

This will be linked up to the drone’s body to allow it to carry items of all sorts.

Delivery drones are useful for when someone needs to get an item that is only a few pounds in weight transported through a particular distance. 

The weight that a drone can handle depends on the model.

Example: Amazon's Prime Air drone is a delivery system in development that will use unmanned aerial vehicles (also called drones) to transport goods from the company's warehouses to the consumer.
