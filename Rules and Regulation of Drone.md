# Can Anyone Fly a Drone? 
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">No, not everyone can fly a drone, but don’t be scared of the rules.</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">It is for safety and everyone should do their best to comply with the regulations.</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">Drones have the potential to hurt or even kill people and damage property.</h4>
<h3 style="font-family:italics;">Different countries have different rules & regulations, so check out your own.</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">As an example; in India there are rules and law binding flying of drones, here are the most important rules to know for flying a drone in India.</h4>
<h3 style="font-family:italics;">Recreational rules – Flying for Fun</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">You must fly for hobby or recreation ONLY (no side jobs or in-kind work allowed).</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">Maximum flight height for drones is 400 feet (120 m).</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">You must fly within visual line-of-sight (VLOS).</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">You must never fly near other aircraft.</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">You must notify the airport and air traffic control tower prior to flying within 5 miles of an airport.</h4>
<h3 style="font-family:italics;">Commercial Rules — Flying for Work and Earning Money</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">Just like a driving license, you will need an Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit or a Remote Pilot Certificate issued by the FAA to fly commercially.</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">Just like your car, you need to register your drone with the government and it will be issued with the Unique Identification Number also known as (UIN).</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">You must fly at or under 100 mph and at or below 400 feet.</h4>
<h5 style="font-family:italics;">Note: Nano Drones don't require UIN or UAOP</h5>
<h3 style="font-family:italics;">Here are the requirements for obtaining the permit: </h3>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">You must be able to read, speak, write, and understand English.</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">You must be in a physical and mental condition to safely operate.</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">You must be at least 16 years old.</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">Drones cannot be flown in areas specified as “No Fly Zones”, which include areas near airports, international borders, Vijay Chowk in Delhi, State Secretariat Complex in State Capitals, strategic locations, and military installations.</h4>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">Permission to fly in controlled airspace can be obtained by filing a flight plan and obtaining a unique Air Defense Clearance (ADC)/Flight Information Center (FIC) number.</h4>
<h3 style="font-family:italics;">India’s No Permission, No Takeoff Policy</h3>
<h4 style="font-family:italics;">Before every single flight, drone pilots are required to request permission to fly via a mobile app, which will automatically process the request and grant or reject it.
  
India is calling their system “No Permission, No Takeoff” (NPNT).
  
If a drone pilot tries to fly without receiving permission from the Digital Sky Platform, he or she will simply not be able to take off.

All drone operators will register their drone and request permission to fly for each flight through India’s Digital Sky Platform. 
  
The Digital Sky Platform and further details will be available on the <a href="https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in/home">DGCA website</a> from December 1, 2018.
